Changes made to original xv6 source code in order to add syscall
getprocsinfo():

NOTE:  Project1.pdf refers to getprocsinfo() and getprocinfo(), but
for consistancy I'm only using getprocsinfo().  It also refers to
testgetprocinfo and testprocinfo, but I called my program, file, and
function testgetprocsinfo to follow the name of the function it was
testing.

Makefile:
- Appended _testgetprocsinfo to UPROGS
- Added testgetprocsinfo.c to EXTRA

syscall.h:
- Made SYS_getprocsinfo 22

syscall.c:
- Appended sys_getprocsinfo to syscalls
- Referenced external function sys_getprocsinfo()

sysproc.c:
- Added getprocsinfo syscall as sys_getprocsinfo()

usys.S:
- Appended getprocsinfo to SYSCALL macro calls

user.h:
- Appended getprocsinfo prototype

testgetprocsinfo.c:
- Created to test getprocsinfo syscall
